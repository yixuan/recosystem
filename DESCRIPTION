Description: This package is an R wrapper of the libmf library
    (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libmf/) for recommender
    system using matrix factorization. It is typically used to
    approximate an incomplete matrix using the product of two
    matrices in a latent space. Other common names for this task
    include "collaborative filtering", "matrix completion",
    "matrix recovery", etc.
